ONLY perform the instruction provided me, do not venture off and touch other parts of code.
Dont add comments.
Generate code in the simplest form possible, be minimal and try to do more with less.
Stick to the main subject and try to not get sidetracked.
If you are confused, do not guess, stop and ask for more guidance.
